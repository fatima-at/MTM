During today's meeting, we discussed two upcoming projects for our development team. The first project is a mobile app for health tracking, which needs to integrate with wearable devices and provide real-time analytics. We aim to deliver a working prototype within three weeks.

The second project involves creating a web-based dashboard for managing IoT sensors across smart homes. The goal is to allow remote configuration, alerting, and data visualization using real-time charts. We are targeting a launch in two months.

Design, backend, and data engineers will be involved in both projects. Tasks and assignments will be determined in follow-up sessions.
